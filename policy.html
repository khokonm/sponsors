                <li>
                    <strong>Approval Process:</strong> Submitted content will undergo a review process to ensure it meets our guidelines. We reserve the right to reject or request modifications to content that do not meet our standards.

                <li>
                    <strong>Duration of Sponsorship:</strong> Sponsorship slots are allocated on a monthly basis. Sponsors must subscribe to our Buy Me a Coffee page to secure sponsorship for a specific month.

                    <strong>Visibility:</strong> Sponsors will be featured on our extension in a dedicated sponsor section. The placement and visibility of sponsor content will be determined by our design and user experience considerations.

                    <strong>Non-Transfer of User Data:</strong> We guarantee that no personal data of our users will be transferred to sponsors. Our commitment to user privacy is paramount, and we adhere to strict data protection policies.
